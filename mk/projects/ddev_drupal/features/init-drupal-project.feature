Feature: Initialize Drupal projects with DDEV.
  In order to start a new Drupal project in a DDEV environment
  As a Drupal Developer
  I need to be able to initialize Drupal projects

  Background:
    Given I bootstrap a clean Drumkit environment

  Scenario: Initialize a Drupal project without a PROJECT_NAME or SITE_NAME should produce an error

    Then I should get:

    Variable SITE_NAME not set
    """
