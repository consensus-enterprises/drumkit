This text is coming from the docs folder inside the drumkit project.

However, Drumkit also has a self-documentation feature built in to provide command line assistance for the most common tasks.

* `make help` - Print a list of available make targets with one-line description 

Note: This is not a comprehensive list of all targets in the library, but an overview of the ones that are intended to be called directly from the command line

To get more information on how to add self-documentation to any new targets that you add, run `make selfdoc-howto`
